Spreadsheet/ReadSXC version 0.10
=================================

Extract OpenOffice 1.x spreadsheet data.

Spreadsheet::ReadSXC extracts data from OpenOffice 1.x
spreadsheet files (.sxc). It exports only one function read_sxc()
which takes a filename and an optional reference to a hash of
options as arguments and returns a hash of references to
two-dimensional arrays. The hash keys correspond to the names of
worksheets in the OpenOffice workbook. The two-dimensional arrays
correspond to rows and cells in the respective spreadsheets.

Spreadsheet::ReadSXC requires XML::Parser to parse the XML
contained in .sxc files. It recursively traverses an XML tree
to find spreadsheet cells and collect their data. Only the contents
of text:p elements are returned, not the actual values of
table:value attributes.

Empty spreadsheet cells correspond to undef values in array rows.
If the .sxc file contains an empty spreadsheet its hash element will
point to an empty array.

Spreadsheet::ReadSXC truncates spreadsheets so that there are no
empty rows after the last row containing data and no empty columns
after the last column containing data (unless the 'NoTruncate'
option is used).

The behaviour of this module is controlled through several options,
namely 'ReplaceNewlineWith', 'IncludeCoveredCells', 'DropHiddenRows',
'DropHiddenColumns', 'NoTruncate', and 'StandardDate'.
