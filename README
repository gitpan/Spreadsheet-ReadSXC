Spreadsheet/ReadSXC version 0.03
=================================

Extract OpenOffice 1.x spreadsheet data.

This is a very simple module for extracting data from OpenOffice 1.x
spreadsheet files (.sxc). It exports only one function read_sxc()
which takes a filename as an argument and returns a hash of references
to two-dimensional arrays. The hash keys correspond to the names of
worksheets in the OpenOffice workbook. The two-dimensional arrays
correspond to rows and cells in the respective spreadsheets.

Spreadsheet::ReadSXC requires XML::Parser::Lite::Tree to parse the
XML contained in .sxc files. It recursively traverses the XML tree
to find spreadsheet cells and collect their data. Only the contents
of text:p elements are returned, not the actual values of
table:value attributes.

Empty spreadsheet cells correspond to undef values in array rows.
If the .sxc file contains an empty spreadsheet its hash element will
point to an empty array.

Spreadsheet::ReadSXC truncates spreadsheets so that there are no
empty rows after the last row containing data and no empty columns
after the last column containing data.
