Spreadsheet/ReadSXC version 0.20
=================================

Extract OpenOffice 1.x spreadsheet data.

Spreadsheet::ReadSXC extracts data from OpenOffice 1.x
spreadsheet files (.sxc). It exports the function read_sxc()
which takes a filename and an optional reference to a hash of
options as arguments and returns a hash of references to
two-dimensional arrays. The hash keys correspond to the names of
worksheets in the OpenOffice workbook. The two-dimensional arrays
correspond to rows and cells in the respective spreadsheets.

Spreadsheet::ReadSXC requires XML::Parser to parse the XML
contained in .sxc files. Only the contents of 'text:p' elements are
returned, not the actual values of 'table:value' attributes.

Empty spreadsheet cells correspond to undef values in array rows.
If the .sxc file contains an empty spreadsheet its hash element will
point to an empty array.

Spreadsheet::ReadSXC truncates spreadsheets so that there are no
empty rows after the last row containing data and no empty columns
after the last column containing data (unless the 'NoTruncate'
option is used).

The behaviour of this module is controlled through several options,
namely 'ReplaceNewlineWith', 'IncludeCoveredCells', 'DropHiddenRows',
'DropHiddenColumns', 'NoTruncate', 'StandardDate', and
'StandardTime'.

I'll add more options in the future so that you can choose between
'text:p' contents and 'table:value' values the same way the
'StandardDate' option lets you use a 'table:date-value' instead of
its 'text:p' equivalent.

I've added the read_xml_file() and read_xml_string() functions in
version 0.10. These approaches could be unified so that read_sxc()
would handle .sxc files, content.xml files, and xml strings
alternatively. H. Merijn Brand's Spreadsheet::ReadData does just
that. It also treats Excel files (using Spreadsheet::ParseExcel)
and CSV files.
